Real World Functional Programming with ZIO

Welcome to the official repository for _Real World Functional Programming with ZIO_, a workshop taught by John A. De Goes, which introduces attendees to functional programming in Scala.

you will learn how to solve problems in asynchronous, concurrent programming using purely functional ZIO library.
work through those following chapters:

 * [Day 2:](https://github.com/jdegoes/zio-workshop/tree/setup/src/main/scala/net/degoes/zio/concurrency/README.md) **ZIO Concurrency**
 * [Day 3:](https://github.com/jdegoes/zio-workshop/tree/setup/src/main/scala/net/degoes/zio/applications/README.md) **ZIO Applications**
